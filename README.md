## ⚙️ Key Objectives
1. **Dataset Collection & Preprocessing**  
   Collect and preprocess datasets (like KITTI or COCO) containing road images for training and testing.

2. **Model Development**  
   Train an **Object Detection model (YOLOv8 / CNN)** to identify:
   - Cars, buses, and trucks  
   - Pedestrians and cyclists  
   - Traffic lights and road signs  

3. **Testing & Evaluation**  
   Evaluate model accuracy using **Precision**, **Recall**, and **mAP (Mean Average Precision)** metrics.  
   Conduct real-time tests with webcam feeds or recorded driving videos.
